# ChemoEnzymaticSynthesis
Computer-assisted multistep chemoenzymatic retrosynthesis using a chemical synthesis planner.


This folder contains the code for identifying enzymatic suggestions within ASKCOS proposed reaction network and single-step retrosynthetic transformations. One example analysis for reaction network and single step transformation is presented. The code is presented as a Jupyter Notebook. Key dependencies include rdkit and rdchiral (https://pypi.org/project/rdchiral/).
